# GW2SteamRunner

GW2 Steam Runner tells Steam that Guild Wars 2 is running as if it were the Steam edition from the Steam store. This helps keep Steam player counts and engagement up. Unfortunately Steam player counts have increasingly influenced player's decisions in which game they might try out. Therefore it is important that Guild Wars 2's player base appears as healthy as it really is, Steam edition or not.

## Features
- Tells Steam you are playing Guild Wars 2, thus accumulating Steam play time and contributing to Steam player counts.
- Allows for opening of Steam in-game overlay (shift+tab by default)

## Install
- Install [GW2 Addon Manager](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/GW2-Addon-Manager)
- Extract the latest release .zip to <your install folder>\addons (e.g. C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2\addons) such that the folder structure looks like:
```
Guild Wars 2
├───addons
|   ├───gw2_steam_runner
|   |       appid.cfg
|   |       gw2addon_gw2_steam_runner.dll
|   |       steam_api64.dll
|   └───<other addons>
└───<game files>
```


## Requirements
- Steam must be running (the addon will start it in the background if it is not running)
- The logged in Steam account must have Guild Wars 2 in their Steam account library (can be added for free via the [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284210/Guild_Wars_2/)) IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE INSTALLED.
